    "    <center><h3>New York Housing Market - EDA</h3><br>\n",
    "<center> This notebook serves as a showcase of my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ability in Python. The purpose of EDA is to gain a comprehensive understanding of a dataset's structure, patterns, and relationships through visual and statistical exploration. By examining data distributions, identifying outliers, and assessing data quality, EDA informs subsequent analysis and hypothesis generation, facilitating effective communication of insights to stakeholders. Therefore, this notebook will primarily emphasize visualisations to ensure that the narrative within the data can be effectively communicated to stakeholders, regardless of their statistical proficiency.\n",
